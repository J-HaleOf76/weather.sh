## 1. About

Weather report written in Bash.

`weather.sh` gets the current weather from 
[OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) and displays the 
results to the terminal, HTML, or for an OpenBox pipe menu. It will 
calculate (if appropriate) the "feel like" weather by calculating the
wind chill or heat index. A great deal of basis for this script comes 
from [BashWeather](https://github.com/jdotjdot/BashWeather),
[bash-weather](https://github.com/szantaii/bash-weather),
and many more that I forgot to save the URLs of.

 * OpenWeatherMap API key ([http://openweathermap.org/appid](http://openweathermap.org/appid)).
 * Bash shell â‰¥ 4.2.
 * `bc` basic calculator for floating point arithmetic. Can be found in the `bc` package on major Linux distributions.
 * `curl` command-line tool for getting data using HTTP protocol. cURL can be found in the `curl` package on major Linux distributions.
 * `grep` command-line tool used for parsing downloaded XML data. `grep` can be found in the `grep` package on major Linux distributions.

## 4. How to use

Run `weather.sh` with the appropriate commandline switches (below). If 
the current conditions do not qualify for the heat index or wind chill, 
it is not displayed.

### `weather_sh.rc`

Copy (and edit, as appropriate) the `weather_sh.rc` file to `$HOME\.config`.   
The first line is the OpenWeatherMap API key  
The second line is your default location  
The third line is your default degree character (either `c` or `f`)
The fourth line is True or False depending on whether or not you want 
icons displayed for the weather.

### Command-line options

`weather.sh` can be started with the following command line options:

 * `-k` Specifies OpenWeatherMap API key from the command-line.
 * `-l city_name` Sets the city for manual weather lookup.
 * `-t` Output to the terminal/stdout (default if no output is specified)
 * `-h` Output HTML formatted text
 * `-o` Output OpenBox output
 * `-f` Use imperial (farenheit, inches Hg, mph) units; default is metric

_Note: If the OpenWeatherMap API key is specified from the command-line, it will override the API key set in the file._
